# Crud App Front-end

The following technical report provides an overview of the Crud App Front-end project. This project serves as an assessment tool to demonstrate how to consume RESTful APIs built with NestJs and TypeORM to connect with MySQL databases. The application allows users to perform simple CRUD operations by storing and receiving data in a MySQL database using a combination of ReactJS, Redux for state management, Axios for API requests, TypeScript, and Styled Components for styling.

To run the application, it is essential to start the backend server. Please refer to this [link](https://github.com/IAmYoungbossy/crud-app-backend) for instructions on how to set up the backend server.

Once the backend server is set up, install all the required packages by invoking the following command:

```
npm install
```

This command will install all the necessary dependencies required for the application to run. After installation, execute the following command to start the application:

```
npm start
```

Upon successful execution, the application is ready for a series of CRUD operations.

In summary, the Crud App Front-end project provides an efficient solution for consuming RESTful APIs built with NestJs and TypeORM to connect with MySQL databases. The project also utilizes a range of advanced technologies, including ReactJS, Redux, Axios, TypeScript, and Styled Components, to provide an efficient and user-friendly front-end solution.
